Weeeeh I can't beat <INSERT BOSSNAME HERE>

Hush little person, don't cry. Here is how you do it.

1. Somethingohedron. (BEEP BOOP BEEP)
	This one just twists and turns. The weakpoints is the pink stuff.
	You can just keep firing at it, really easy.

2. Homework Birdhouse. (DO YOUR HOMEWOOOORK!)
	Its the eyes, if it wasn't obvious.
	Make sure you're following the eyes.

3. Marshmellow Matrix. (KETCHUUUUP ALL OVER YOUUU)
	The pink center marshmellow is the weakspot.
	Go to the center of the screen as fast as possible and stay there.

4. Elephant. (HAHAHA YOU CAN'T DEFEAT ME!)
	Again with the eyes. Rock left and right in sync so the last bullet
	in your mouthbeam is always connecting to the eye closest to the camera.

5. Homework Birdhouse (DO YOUR HOMEWOOOORK!)
	Same as 2, but a lot faster.

6. Clownface (HAHAHA)
	The eyes and lips this time.
	The easiest spot is the right half of his lips. If you aim for the far right part of his lip you 
	can keep hitting it as it turns. Once you found the sweetspot stay there. 

7. UFO (UFO WHAAA)
	This one is really tricky. You have to rotate at the same rate as the ufo but slightly ahead.
	I usually go for the center.

8. PANFLUTE (TEEDOODEEDOODEEEEEEEEEEEEWOOOOOOOOOOOOO)
	You can't defeat it. It's the devil. He is immortal. DIE! DIE! DIE!
