FAQ:
	Q:	Why do I get a headache playing this game?
	A:	SHUT THE GAME DOWN IMMEDIATELY SHOULD YOU FEEL ANY DISCOMFORT PLAYING IT.
		You can do this by pressing escape.
		Some of its flickering goes well below the 13hz range and could trigger 
		epileptic seizures in about 1/100000 of people. 
		Even if they haven't experienced these before. 
		Though we've gone lengths to make sure we stay above 30hz, watch out!

	Q:	How do I beat boss X?
	A (spoilerfree): They're kind of like puzzles. Find the weakspot. Try flowing with it! 
	A (SPOILERS!):	 Each boss has a time-limit, weakspots and a certain flow to them.
		Make sure the last bullet of your mouthbeam connects 
		to the weakpoint as often as possible. 
		Sometimes this means imitating its movement.
		Sometimes this means staying still.
		That said, you can't beat hell's panflute so don't even try.
		If you're still stuck, read WALKTHROUGH.md

	Q:	Did you really make all this from scratch in a week?
	A:	Yes. All music, art and script was made and written by Team Momojo from scratch.
		Except for the explosions that are gifs we found on the net and recolored.
		And some public domain glass breaking sounds from freesound.org.
		Also pygame existed already.

	Q:	Were you on drugs making this?
	A:	Not while, but the programmer/designer certainly was before and after.

	Q:	Can you tell us more about Team Momojo? Who are you people?
	A:	Our parents taught us to never give out our real names on the internet. 
		We are three dutch people. 
		A programmer/game designer, a graphics designer and a sound designer/composer.
		There's also a cat that does LAZERS.
